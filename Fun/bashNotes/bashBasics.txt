    FILES:
        "The directional operators for redirecting output to a file are > and >>.
         The difference between them is that the > operator overwrites the 
         contents of the specified file if it already exists, while the >> operator appends the output to the end of the file
         If the file doesn't exist, it is created."
        nano <file name> -makes and opens a file with easy to use interface
        cat <file name> - view a file
        printf "<text>" > <file name> -writes to a file

        cd /
        ls
