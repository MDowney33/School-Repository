#Python is an object-oriented programming language. That means that everything we
#use and create in Python is considered an object. An object can be considered a positive
#that which ecapsulates properties and behaviors

#What we do when we create an int is we are instantiating an object of the abstract class, "integer." We instantiate an integer
#when we use its "literal."
#-A "literal" is the absolute representation of an object and its value. (eg 123 is itself a literal)



#Assignment statement
num = 125
print(num)

#Identifying a type of object

print(type(num))

#Checking id of an object

print(id(num))

#Print the object


num = 125
#1. Integer object is instantiated with a value of 125
#->"instantiation" means an object of a particular class is created and stored in computer memory.
